# LightWave Pro Tools

## Intro
This page contains a link to the original ODTools documentation for each of the tools in the 2018 and 2019 collections, now included in LightWave 2023 as LightWave Pro Tools. The 243 entries prefaced by an x have no written documentation. There is video documentation for 215 of the 413 tools here and here, with links to individual videos where available.

The total quantity of these plugins is quite overwhelming and there's no way you'll use all of them. The trick is to skim over the descriptions and find a few that will really help your workflow, so here's a list of where to start. It's compiled by our top beta testers, people who spend hours in LightWave every day so you know it'll be good.

It would be surprising if you used more than 50 of these plugins regularly. The trick is that the 50 essential plugins will be different for everyone.

### Assign plugin to a keyboard shortcut

Assigning something to a key is simple. All you need to do is hit <shortcut>Alt-F9</shortcut> or choose Edit > Edit
Keyboard Shortcuts...

Find the plugin you want in the left menu, here I've chosen the Instance Baker. In the right window, I've scrolled down until I've found a keyboard shortcut I like and I've selected it. Now I can click Assign at top right and Done. Now, I can hit i to bake my instances instead of having to find the plugin every time. You can also replace standard keyboard shortcut items with the improved Pro Tools versions.

### Assign plugin to a menu

Pro Tools will have their own menu by default when you install LightWave, but adding plugins to menus to customize your
setup is equally simple. Go to Edit > Edit Menu Layout... or use <shortcut>Alt-F10</shortcut> and this window appears.

Type in the search window or scroll the left menu to find the plugin you want. Here we're using the CamZoom Control. In the right menu, scroll down and open hierarchies to find the perfect place to put it. You can also replace standard menu items with the improved Pro Tools versions.

### Add plugin to a mouse button
To add a plugin to a mouse button, you need to add it to a keyboard shortcut first. It doesn't matter how difficult the shortcut is, or how memorable. You'll never use it directly. Now, open up your mouse driver software. Here, I am showing the Logitech Logi Options+ application that controls a wide range of mice, your application might be different.

Add the application for which you want to assign this button. If you don't do this, the keyboard shortcut you want for LightWave specifically will be used for all applications. Click the mouse button you wish to use and choose Keyboard shortcut. Now, type the keyboard shortcut you chose for your plugin and from here on you will just be able to click a mouse button to use the plugin you chose in LightWave.

The video demonstrations linked here will be replaced little-by-little by LightWave Digital and this page will be accordingly updated. If there's a plugin from this collection that you really like, tell me why. Let me know at docs@lightwave3d.com and I might add your recommendation to the list at the top.
