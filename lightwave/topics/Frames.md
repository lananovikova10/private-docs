# Frames

Frames are a good way of organising your nodes and can be useful to provide additional information for users not familiar with how your node network functions. You can move nodes inside frames for them to be "captured" so they move when the frame moves, but equally drag them outside to free them. Nodes are only captured on release of the mouse button. The top-left corner of a node needs to be inside a frame to be captured. You can equally drag Frames over nodes to capture them and select nodes to be captured and click the right mouse button on the title bar of the frame to Fit the frame to selected nodes.
